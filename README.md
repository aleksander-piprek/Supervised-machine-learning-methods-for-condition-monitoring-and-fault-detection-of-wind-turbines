# Supervised machine learning methods for condition monitoring and fault detection of wind turbines
This is my code repository for my Engineering Thesis. The goal of the thesis was to use three Supervised Machine Learning algorithms, being Support-vector machine, k-Nearest neighbors and Gaussian process regression to detect faults and predict abnormalities in behaviour of a wind turbine. 

## Dataset
Data was acquired from a wind farm based in La Haute-Borne, France. <br />
